GitHub tutorial Hello-World

Hi! 

I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more - and loving it! After graduating in 2010 with degrees in commerce (information systems and management) and law, I took the law option and have been working as a litigation lawyer for 6 years. Leaving my home in New Zealand to come to London, UK - I have realised that, no matter where in the world I practice law, it makes me miserable. 

One cold night spent chewing the fat (and drinking the pints..) with a developer-friend in Kensel Green led me to Treehouse, and I'm hooked. I learned JavaScript on .NET in my Information Sysetms degree sometime in 2008, and was pleased to find myself remembering the basics as I have progressed through the Treehouse courses. 

As my social life recedes due to my new found learning obsession taking up much of my spare time, I remain ready and committed to do what it takes to start on the path I should have gone down out of school - and become a professional developer. 

My name is Thomas Wood, pleased to meet you.
